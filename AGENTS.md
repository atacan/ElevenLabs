# Code Generation from OpenAPI

This project generates Swift code from an OpenAPI document. 

**Important for AI coding agents:**
- The Swift code in `GeneratedSources/` folders is auto-generated from `openapi.json`
- `original.json` is the downloaded OpenAPI spec - **DO NOT EDIT**
- `overlay_generated_*.json` files are auto-generated by scripts to fix common errors - **DO NOT EDIT**
- Generated Swift code - **DO NOT EDIT**
- To modify the generated code, edit `overlay.json` instead
- Run `make prepare-openapi` to regenerate code after overlay changes
